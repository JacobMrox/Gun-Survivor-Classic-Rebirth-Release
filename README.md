# Why

Biohazard: Gun Survivor (known in China as 惡靈古堡：生存遊戲 and internationally Resident Evil: Survivor) was released on PC exclusively in China and Taiwan, and that version has long been infamous for its instability, bugs, and poor technical implementation. On modern systems, the game is extremely difficult—if not impossible—to run properly due to outdated APIs, broken dependencies, and compatibility issues.

Inspired by [Classic Rebirth](https://classicrebirth.com/) by Gemini-Loboto3. This project exists to modernize and preserve the PC version of Gun Survivor by replacing legacy systems with modern, stable alternatives. The goal is not only to make the game playable on current hardware and operating systems, but also to improve its overall usability, performance, and configurability—without altering the original experience.

In short, this project aims to:

* Restore playability on modern Windows systems
* Replace obsolete or broken APIs
* Fix long-standing bugs and technical issues
* Add quality-of-life improvements and configuration options
* Lay the groundwork for further enhancements and modding

# Installation

1) Click <> Code → Download ZIP
2) Extract all files into your game installation directory, replacing any files when prompted.
3) The game requires every included file to run correctly, including GBIO.CFG (a dummy file the original game expects at startup).
4) This requirement will be automated by the DLL in the next version
5) This project is provided free, as-is, without warranty, and will continue improving over time

## Note

If something does not work, double check that all files were copied correctly first. Most issues come from incomplete installation rather than the tool itself.

The screenshot below shows an example of a *fake account's* comment that was later removed by YouTube moderation. It incorrectly blamed the project for user-side setup errors:

P.S. I have a fairly good idea who that person is but let's all just calm down ^
